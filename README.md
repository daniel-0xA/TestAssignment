The TestAssignment is a CMake project, generated with CLion.

The ./script.sh runs on a Ubuntu 20.04 system with docker installed.

On Win10, running the script als batch file, does not work, docker thrown error. (something with OCI, I think is related with mounting a volume).

Tested on Mac M1, running the bin file (not docker), also work.
